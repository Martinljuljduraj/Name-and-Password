This program asks the user to enter a first name and a last name, then automatically generates a simple user ID by combining the first letter of the first name, the first four letters of the last name (or fewer if the last name is short), andtwo random digits.

After displaying the generated ID, the program prompts the user to create a password and lists the rules it must follow (uppercase, lowercase, no spaces, and only certain special characters).
